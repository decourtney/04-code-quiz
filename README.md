# Coding Kombat Quiz

## Description
The purpose of this project was the create a timed quiz and use Javascript to control adding, removing, and modifying html elements.
I attempted to add a bit more visual appeal and interaction than just presenting questions. I included an html canvas and scripted some spritesheets to animate based on the users selected answers. However, due to time contraints the combat portion of the quiz is purely aesthetics and hold no bearing on the users score.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The site loads to a Start screen and a main menu and high scores button - similar to retro games. Once the user clicks Start a character select screen and Ready button appear. The character select is non-functional. Clicking Ready will begin the quiz - once an answered is selected another question will display and continue to do so until the user runs out of time or questions. Upon Game Over the high scores screen will appear and the user will be able to enter their initials. Scores are saved to local storage.
